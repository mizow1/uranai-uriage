# Requirements Document

## Introduction

現在のコードベースは複数回の改修により、冗長な処理、無駄な処理、重複処理が散見される状況となっています。システムの保守性、可読性、パフォーマンスを向上させるため、コードベース全体のリファクタリングを実施します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate duplicate code across different modules, so that the codebase is more maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate functions are identified THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into shared utility modules
2. WHEN similar processing logic exists in multiple files THEN the system SHALL extract common functionality into reusable components
3. WHEN code consolidation is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove redundant processing steps, so that the system runs more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN redundant file processing operations are identified THEN the system SHALL eliminate unnecessary duplicate operations
2. WHEN multiple similar data transformation steps exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into single, efficient operations
3. WHEN processing optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the same output quality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to standardize error handling across all modules, so that debugging and maintenance are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inconsistent error handling patterns are found THEN the system SHALL implement a unified error handling approach
2. WHEN error logging is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL standardize logging formats and levels
3. WHEN error handling is standardized THEN all error scenarios SHALL be properly captured and reported

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate configuration management, so that system settings are centralized and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple configuration approaches are identified THEN the system SHALL implement a single configuration management system
2. WHEN configuration files are scattered THEN the system SHALL centralize configuration into a unified structure
3. WHEN configuration is consolidated THEN all modules SHALL use the same configuration interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate unused code and dead code paths, so that the codebase is cleaner and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused functions or variables are identified THEN the system SHALL remove them safely
2. WHEN dead code paths are found THEN the system SHALL eliminate them while preserving active functionality
3. WHEN code cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have no unreachable or unused code

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to standardize data processing patterns, so that similar operations are handled consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar data processing operations exist THEN the system SHALL implement standardized processing patterns
2. WHEN file reading/writing operations are inconsistent THEN the system SHALL use unified file handling approaches
3. WHEN data validation is scattered THEN the system SHALL implement centralized validation logic

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to improve code organization and structure, so that the codebase is easier to navigate and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN poorly organized code is identified THEN the system SHALL restructure it following consistent patterns
2. WHEN module responsibilities are unclear THEN the system SHALL implement clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN code structure is improved THEN the system SHALL follow established architectural patterns
